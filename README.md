=======
This project aims to accurately gauge investorâ€™s sentiment of stocks using social media platforms such as Twitter, and Stocktwits. While fundamental factors, such as revenue, cost, profit, and cashflow, play a vital role in the valuation of a publicly traded stock, at the end of the day the price is determined by supply and demand. The sentiment of buyers is a great indicator of demand and could provide insights towards the movement of price in the future and aid in finding opportunities for profitable trades.
